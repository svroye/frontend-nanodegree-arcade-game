===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


## RUN THE GAME
Open the game in the browser. Default settings for the game are Easy difficulty and the boy character.
The game immediately starts. You can change the difficulty of the game by clicking the radio buttons on the left of the game (easy, medium or hard). You can also change the character you are playing with by checking the radio button of the character of your choice.

## PLAY THE GAME
The main purpose of the game is reaching the water on the other side of the street. When reaching the water, you get 10 points. Doing this, you must avoid the bugs traversing the street. Hitting a bug lowers your score by 5 points and resets the position of the character. Try to reach a score as high as possible.
