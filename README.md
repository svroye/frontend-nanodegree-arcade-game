## PLAY THE GAME
The main purpose of the game is reaching the water on the other side of the street. When reaching the water, you get 10 points. Doing this, you must avoid the bugs traversing the street. Hitting a bug lowers your score by 5 points and resets the position of the character. Try to reach a score as high as possible, but watch out, a negative score is also possible !
